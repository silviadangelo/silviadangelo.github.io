Currently there is a dearth of methods to model the relationship between multiple biomarkers and single food
intake measurements. The multiMarker framework has been developed to address this deficiency, and further allow intake predictions from biomarker data alone. Differently from previous approaches, distributions of predicted intakes are provided, directly accounting for uncertainty in the food intake quantification.
multiMarker has been implemented in the form of two homonymous softwares, an R package and a Shiny web application,
to facilitate easy access to and widespread use of the framework.
