        "des2":"A package for latent space models for binary multivariate networks (multiplex). The model assumes that the nodes in the multiplex lie in a low-dimensional latent space. The probability of two nodes being connected is inversely related to their distance in this latent space: nodes close in the space are more likely to be linked, while nodes that are far apart are less likely to be connected. Inference is carried out via a MCMC algorithm."

The model is framed within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, which provides flexibility to adapt to different biomarker distributions and facilitates prediction of the intake along with its associated uncertainty. Details are in D'Angelo, et al. (2020)."

The biomarker based calibration equation was developed from urinary proline betaine and mean daily intake (estimated from a 4 day food diary) and is used to correct self-report estimates for measurement error."
