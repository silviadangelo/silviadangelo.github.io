Prior to this, I was an Assistant Professor in Statistics in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at University College Dublin, where in the past I have also worked as a PostDoc in the [VistaMilk SFI Research Centre](https://www.vistamilk.ie/) with [Prof. Claire Gormley](https://sites.google.com/view/clairegormley/) and in the [ERC-ADIET](https://www.ucdnutrimarkers.com/a-diet) project with Prof. Claire Gormley and [Prof. Lorraine Brennan](https://people.ucd.ie/lorraine.brennan).
