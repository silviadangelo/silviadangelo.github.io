A latent variable model based on factor analytic and mixture of experts models, designed to infer food intake from multiple biomarkers data. The model is framed within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, which provides flexibility to adapt to different biomarker distributions and facilitates inference on food intake from biomarker data alone, along with the associated uncertainty. Details are in D'Angelo, et al. (2020) <arXiv:2006.02995>.
