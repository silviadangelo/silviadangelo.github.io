Hi! I am a [Lecturer/ Assistant Professor in Statistics](https://people.ucd.ie/silvia.dangelo) at University College Dublin. Prior to this, I worked a PostDoc in the [VistaMilk SFI Research Centre](https://www.vistamilk.ie/) with [Prof. Claire Gormley](https://sites.google.com/view/clairegormley/) and in the [ERC-ADIET](https://www.ucdnutrimarkers.com/a-diet) project with Prof. Claire Gormley and [Prof. Lorraine Brennan](https://people.ucd.ie/lorraine.brennan). 
I obtained a PhD in Statistics from Sapienza, University of Rome, working with [Prof. Marco Alfo'](https://www.dss.uniroma1.it/it/dipartimento/alf-marco).

Together with [Dr. Michael Fop](https://michaelfop.github.io/), we are the organizers of the Working Group on Statistical Learning ([WGSL](https://maths.ucd.ie/seminarseries/wgsl)) and the Statistics and Actuarial Science ([SAS](https://maths.ucd.ie/seminarseries/sas)) seminar and webinar series at University College Dublin. Seminars and Webinars are live-streamed on [Zoom](https://ucd-ie.zoom.us/j/68316324831).

I am currently in the committee of the Young Statisticiansâ€™ Section of the Irish Statistical Association ([Young-ISA](https://young-istat.github.io/)). Among other things, we organize monthly statistics webinars, check them out [here](https://young-istat.github.io/webinars/)!
