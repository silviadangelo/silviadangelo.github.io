      <description>Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments. Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

Currently there is a dearth of methods to model the relationship between multiple biomarkers and single food intake measurements. The multiMarker framework has been developed to address this deficiency, and further allow intake predictions from biomarker data alone. Differently from previous approaches, distributions of predicted intakes are provided, directly accounting for uncertainty in the food intake quantification.</description>

Metabolomic based approaches have gained much attention in recent years due to their promising potential to deliver objective tools for assessment of food intake. In particular, multiple biomarkers have emerged for single foods. However, there is a lack of statistical tools available for combining multiple biomarkers to infer food intake. Furthermore, there is a paucity of approaches for estimating the uncertainty around biomarker based prediction of intake.</description>

Multidimensional network data can have different levels of complexity, as nodes may be characterized by heterogeneous individual‐specific features, which may vary across the networks. This article introduces a class of models for multidimensional network data, where different levels of heterogeneity within and between networks can be considered. The proposed framework is developed in the family of latent space models, and it aims to distinguish symmetric relations between the nodes and node‐specific features.</description>

Network data are relational data recorded among a group of individuals, the nodes. Multiple relations observed among the same set of nodes may be represented by means of different networks, using a so-called multidimensional network, or multiplex. We propose a latent space model for network data that enables clustering of the nodes in a latent space, with clusters in this space corresponding to communities of nodes.</description>

Measurement error associated with self-reported dietary intake is a well-documented issue. Combining biomarkers of food intake and dietary intake data is a high priority. The aim of this study was to develop calibration equations for food intake, illustrated with an application for citrus intake. Further, a simulation-based framework was developed to determine the portion of biomarker data needed for stable calibration equation estimation in large population studies.</description>

The Eurovision Song Contest is a popular TV singing competition held annually among country members of the European Broadcasting Union. In this competition, each member can be both contestant and jury, as it can participate with a song and/or vote for other countries&amp;rsquo; tunes. During the years, the voting system has repeatedly been accused of being biased by tactical voting; votes would represent strategic interests rather than actual musical preferences of the voting countries.</description>

Multiple causes of death describe complex death processes marked by the simultaneous presence of several diseases and conditions, primarily at older ages. We intend to explore the opportunity offered by the Social Network Analysis (SNA) in the study of multiple relationships in the causes of death. SNA allowed us to reconstruct the complex system of relationships linking the causes of death mentioned in the same death certificate for Italian men and women aged 65 years and over in 2011.</description>

Neuroscience and neuroimaging have been providing new challenges for statisticians and quantitative researchers in general. As datasets of increasing complexity and dimension become available, the need for statistical techniques to analyze brain related phenomena becomes prominent. In this paper, we delve into data coming from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI).</description>

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&#39;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <description>BOSH (Bosh Outer SHell) &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;is an open source tool for release engineering, deployment, lifecycle management, and monitoring of distributed systems.&amp;rdquo; And it&#39;s amazingly powerful. This examples uses BOSH to provision an Alassian vendor app running on JDK along with the support Postgres database and agents to support it. The releases manages the health of services and will automatically provision, start/stop processes across the various services.</description>

      <description>Intro Doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;rdquo; attack.</description>
