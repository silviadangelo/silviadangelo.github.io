**Bio-Intake** (Biomarker guided dietary intake) allows users to upload mean daily self-reported citrus intake data (g/day) (estimated from food diaries) and computes calibrated intakes (g/day) based on a biomarker calibration equation. The biomarker based calibration equation was developed from urinary proline betaine and mean daily intake (estimated from a 4 day food diary) and is used to correct self-report estimates for measurement error.
