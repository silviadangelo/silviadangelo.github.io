Social network data are relational data recorded among a group of actors, interacting in different contexts. Often, the same set of actors can be characterized by multiple social relations, captured by a multidimensional network. A common situation is that of colleagues working in the same institution, whose social interactions can be defined on professional and personal levels. In addition, individuals in a network tend to interact more frequently with similar others, naturally creating communities. Latent space models for network data are useful to recover clustering of the actors, as they allow to represent similarities between them by their positions and relative distances in an interpretable low dimensional social space. We propose the infinite latent position cluster model for multidimensional network data, which enables model-based clustering of actors interacting across multiple social dimensions. The model is based on a Bayesian nonparametric framework, that allows to perform automatic inference on the clustering allocations, the number of clusters, and the latent social space. The method is tested on simulated data experiments, and it is employed to investigate the presence of communities in two multidimensional networks recording relationships of different types among colleagues.
